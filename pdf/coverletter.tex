\lettersection{About Me}
As someone with a lifetime love of relational mathematics and pattern recognition, I thrive on digging
into complex datasets and producing insightful, data-driven strategic recommendations. Throughout my
career, I have enjoyed working in multiple domains such as Product Analytics, Growth Marketing and
Customer Intelligence.I never limit my work from data within “modeling” and “reporting”. I strive to translate the work to
achieve core business values. In my current and previous roles, I recommended methods to improve
product features for user retention, implemented new processes for defining product life cycles, optimized
marketing spends, developed a personalized product recommender engine, and assisted with several
stages of data-driven decision making that resulted in new capabilities of growth in the organization. I
have worked on several strategic projects, and the experience has prepared me to launch my own
initiatives and lead change.


As an electronics engineering student i developed a great interest towards Embedded systems.I underwent 6 week training program and i found the subject very stimulating.It involved a great deal of independent research to self-learn Arduino and Raspberry-Pi and i have hands-on experience in working with them.As part of my role as programmer in my college clubs i learned NodeJS and Python.More than an year I have been working on Internet of Things.Hackathons are the way through which i developed a great interest in Internet of Things.My experiences from hackathons has prepared me for doing projects like tracking the location of college buses and remote patient monitoring wearable using Node-Red programming and IBM bluemix as web platform.
my final year project is Remote monitoring of 3 phase Induction motor from which i learned to build webapps using Google Polymer and Cordova The key aspects of my background apart from IoT enthusiast are Embedded software development, web development and Industrial automation.
The enclosed resume can serve as a more detailed view of my skills ,accomplishments,and what i have to offer to your company .If you have questions or need more information, you may reach me through the phone number or email below.I look forward to having the chance to ​exhibit my knowledge in Internet of Things​.I have the enthusiasm and determination to ensure that I make a success of it.
