\lettersection{About Me}
As someone with a lifetime love of relational mathematics and pattern recognition, I thrive on digging
into complex datasets and producing insightful, data-driven strategic recommendations. Throughout my
career, I have enjoyed working in multiple domains such as Product Analytics, Growth Marketing and
Customer Intelligence.
I never limit my work from data within “modeling” and “reporting”. I strive to translate the work to
achieve core business values. In my current and previous roles, I recommended methods to improve
product features for user retention, implemented new processes for defining product life cycles, optimized
marketing spends, developed a personalized product recommender engine, and assisted with several
stages of data-driven decision making that resulted in new capabilities of growth in the organization. I
have worked on several strategic projects, and the experience has prepared me to launch my own
initiatives and lead change.

\lettersection{Why ABN AMRO?}
● It gives a unique opportunity to comprehensively develop expertise in the complete spectrum of
data science, by providing a chance to work on a variety of business situations.
● I truly enjoy interacting with stakeholders and designing data-driven solutions. Throughout my
work experience I have built a successful track record of developing solutions and maintaining
relationships with internal/external stakeholders such as the Senior Leadership Team at Cisco and
the Product Team at Shopify. Hence the opportunity at ABN AMRO would offer me a niche work
experience.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
Based on my personal and professional experiences, I can bring to ABN AMRO the following:
● be a practical problem solver; I can develop frameworks for solving problems, which will allow
for quickly defining, diagnosing, and resolving issues.
● deal with complex data of varying quality; I excel with big ideas when put with constraints.
● deliver trustworthy solutions to production; I can successfully run champion-challenger tests and
produce a ‘minimum-lovable’ model/report with deeper insights.
● pick-up domain/industry understanding quickly; I thrive to talk the language and map problems to
solutions and,
● have meaningful dialogue with business stakeholders; I can continually monitor expectations, and
remain responsive to their needs and opinions.

Thank you for considering my application and hopefully we’ll speak soon.
