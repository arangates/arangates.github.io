\lettersection{About Me}
I came across your Senior Software Engineer role on Honest Work and I was fascinated by how you’re applying machine learning to the burger industry. Having spent the past 15 years consuming burgers whilst earning a living writing python, I think this is a wonderful opportunity to marry my skills with my passion and join a disruptive BurgerTech organisation.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I have spent the past few years working for a company where I was able to significantly improve my python experience, working on large scale applications whilst surrounded by a fantastic team of engineers. Most recently, I started working on backend development on a major project where I had the opportunity to learn from a great team of 5 engineers to deliver a critical new feature for the platform which resulted in a significant increase in revenue.

Thank you for considering my application and hopefully we’ll speak soon.
